%{God does not play dice with the universe; He plays an ineffable game of His own
%devising, which might be compared, from the perspective of any of the other
%players [i.e. everybody], to being involved in an obscure and complex variant of
%poker in a pitch-dark room, with blank cards, for infinite stakes, with a Dealer
%who won't tell you the rules, and who \emph{smiles all the time}.}
%{Terry Pratchett, \emph{Good Omens}}
