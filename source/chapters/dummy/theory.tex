\section{Quantum Chromodynamics}
Quantum chromodynamics (\QCD) is the non-Abelian \SUgroup{3} gauge theory of the strong interaction.
Initially, it appears similar to \QED, with the single electric charge replaced by three conserved ``colour'' charges; there are, however, important differences between the two.


\subsection{QCD Compton Scattering and Boson-Gluon Fusion}
Here is an example of \texttt{feynmf} to produce Feynman diagrams.
The Makefile should be able to cope with them, but if not, to build \texttt{feynmf} files.
this is \SI{300}{\TeV} in text mode.
this is $\SI{300}{\TeV}$ in math mode.
