\chapter{Theoretical Framework}\label{chap:theory}

The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics \cite{Gaillard:1998ui,Novaes:1999yn} is the theory describing all known elementary particles and their interactions via three of the four fundamental forces.
Developed by merging the successful theories of quantum mechanics and special relativity in the second half of the 20th century, the SM's position today at the centre of our understanding of the nature of the Universe is firmly established by an unparalleled level of agreement between the model's predictions and experimental results~\cite{morel2020determination,sailer2022measurement}.

The SM has predicted the discovery of the top and bottom quarks \cite{CDF:1995wbb,D0:1995jca,Herb:1977ek}, the \Wboson and \Zboson bosons \cite{UA1:1983crd}, and the tau neutrino \cite{DONUT:2000fbd}.
The last missing piece of the SM to be discovered was the Higgs boson, first theorised in the 1960s \cite{Englert:1964et,Higgs:1964pj,Guralnik:1964eu}, and eventually observed at the \LHC in 2012 \cite{HIGG-2012-27,CMS-HIG-12-028}.
After its discovery, much ongoing work has been carried out performing detailed measurements of its mass and interactions with other particles.

In this chapter, an overview of the SM is given in \cref{sec:standard_model}, and a more detailed discussion of the Higgs sector and Higgs phenomenology is provided in \cref{sec:sm_higgs}.

\section{The Standard Model}\label{sec:standard_model}

The SM is formulated in the language of Quantum Field Theory (QFT).
In this framework, particles are localised excitations of corresponding quantum fields, which are operator-valued distributions across spacetime.

Central to QFT is the Lagrangian density which describes the kinematics and dynamics of a field.
Observations of conserved quantities are linked, via Noether's theorem, to symmetries which are expressed by the Lagrangian.
Alongside Global Poincar\'e symmetry, the SM Lagrangian observes a local non-Abelian $SU(3)_C \otimes SU(2)_L \otimes U(1)_Y$ gauge symmetry.
Gauge symmetries leave observable properties of the system unchanged when the corresponding gauge transformations are applied to the fields.
The full Lagrangian of the SM can be broken up into distinct terms corresponding to the different sectors, as in \cref{eq:sm_lagrangian}.
An overview of each sector is given in the following chapters.
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:sm_lagrangian}
  \mathcal{L}_{\textnormal{SM}} = \mathcal{L}_{\textnormal{EW}} + \mathcal{L}_{\textnormal{QCD}} + \mathcal{L}_{\textnormal{Higgs}} + \mathcal{L}_{\textnormal{Yukawa}}
\end{equation}
%
The SM provides a mathematical description of how the electromagnetic, weak and strong forces interact with the matter content of the Universe.
The particle content of the SM consists of \spinhalf fermions, listed in \cref{tab:sm_fermions}, and integral spin bosons listed in \cref{tab:sm_bosons}.

\begin{comment}
  In quantum physics and chemistry, quantum numbers describe values of conserved quantities in the dynamics of a quantum system. Quantum numbers correspond to eigenvalues of operators that commute with the Hamiltonian—quantities that can be known with precision at the same time as the system's energy[note 1]—and their corresponding eigenspaces. Together, a specification of all of the quantum numbers of a quantum system fully characterize a basis state of the system, and can in principle be measured together.

\subsection{Quantum Electrodynamics}\label{sec:qed}

Quantum electrodynamics (QED) is the relativistic quantum theory which describes the interactions between the photon and charged matter.
Consider a Dirac spinor field $\psi = \psi(x)$ and its adjoint $\overline{\psi} = \psi^\dagger \gamma^0$, where $\psi^\dagger$ denotes the Hermitian conjugate of $\psi$.
The field $\psi$ describes a fermionic \spinhalf particle, for example an electron.
The Dirac Lagrangian density is
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:dirac_lagrangian}
  \mathcal{L}_{\textnormal{Dirac}} = \overline{\psi} (i \slashed{\partial}  - m )\psi,
\end{equation}
%
where $\slashed{\partial} = \gamma^\mu \partial_\mu$ denotes the contraction with the Dirac gamma matrices $\gamma^\mu$ (summation over up-down pairs of indices is assumed).
Application of the Euler-Lagrange equation on \cref{eq:dirac_lagrangian} yields the Dirac equation
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:dirac_eq}
  (i \slashed{\partial}  - m )\psi = 0 .
\end{equation}
%
Suppose some fundamental symmetry that requires invariance under a local $U(1)$ gauge transformation
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:U(1)_transformation}
  \psi \rightarrow \psi' = \psi e^{- i q \alpha(x)} ,
\end{equation}
%
where $\alpha$ varies over every spacetime point $x$.
Under this transformation, the Dirac equation transforms as 
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:dirac_eq_transformed}
  (i \slashed{\partial} - m ) \psi e^{- i q \alpha(x)} + q \slashed{\partial}\alpha(x) \psi e^{- i q \alpha(x)} = 0.
\end{equation}
%
For the Dirac equation to remain invariant under the transformation in \cref{eq:U(1)_transformation}, a new field $A_\mu$ which transforms as $A_\mu \rightarrow A'_\mu = A_\mu + \partial_\mu \alpha(x)$ must be added.
The transformed interaction term
%
\begin{equation}
  - q \slashed{A} \psi \rightarrow - q \slashed{A} \psi e^{- i q \alpha(x)} - q \slashed{\partial} \alpha(x) \psi e^{- i q \alpha(x)}
\end{equation}
%
will then cancel the asymmetric term in \cref{eq:dirac_eq_transformed} as required.
The $U(1)$ invariant Lagrangian can therefore be constructed by adding an interaction between the $\psi$ and $A_\mu$ fields to \cref{eq:dirac_lagrangian}. For completeness, the kinetic term for the new field $A_\mu$ is also added in terms of $F_{\mu\nu} = \partial_\mu A_\nu - \partial_\nu A_\mu$, which is trivially invariant under the transformation in \cref{eq:U(1)_transformation}.
The interaction term is typically absorbed into the covariant derivative $D_\mu = \partial_\mu + i q A_\mu$, thus named as it transforms in the same way as the field $\psi$.
Collecting these modifications to \cref{eq:dirac_lagrangian} yields the QED Lagrangian
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:qed_lagrangian}
  \mathcal{L}_{\textnormal{QED}} = -\frac{1}{4} F_{\mu\nu} F^{\mu\nu} + \overline{\psi} (i \slashed{D} - m )\psi .
\end{equation}
%
Requiring invariance under local $U(1)$ gauge transformations necessitated the addition of a new field $A_\mu$, interpreted as the photon field, which interacts with charged matter.
The quadratic mass term $A_\mu A^\mu$ is not invariant and therefore the field $A_\mu$ is required to be massless.
In the SM, the QED Lagrangian is absorbed into the electroweak sector, discussed in \cref{sec:ew_sector}.


\subsection{Quantum Chromodynamics}\label{sec:qcd}

Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the study of quarks, gluons and their interactions.
Quarks and gluons carry colour charge, which comes in three kinds, called red, green and blue.
While the $U(1)$ symmetry group in \cref{sec:qed} was Abelian, the QCD Lagrangian is specified by requiring invariance under transformations from the non-Abelian $SU(3)$ group, making it a Yang\nobreakdash-Mills theory \cite{PhysRev.96.191} which requires the addition of self-interacting gauge fields.
The infinitesimal $SU(3)$ group generators are given by $T_a = \lambda_a / 2$, where $\lambda_a$ are the eight Gell\nobreakdash-Mann matrices.
These span the space of infinitesimal group transformations and do not commute with each other, instead satisfying the commutation relation
%
\begin{equation}
  \com{T_a}{T_b} = i f_{abc} T_c ,
\end{equation}
%
where $f_{abc}$ are the group's structure constants.
Consider the six quark fields $q_k = q_k(x)$.
Each flavour of quark $q_k$ transforms in the fundamental triplet representation, in which each component of the triplet corresponds to the colour quantum number for red, green and blue colour charged respectively.
$G^{a}_{\mu\nu}$ are the eight gluon field strength tensors, one for each generator $T_a$, defined as
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:qcd_field_strength_tensor}
  G^a_{\mu\nu} = \partial_\mu A_\nu - \partial_\nu A_\mu - g_s f^{abc} A_\mu^b A_\nu^c ,
\end{equation}
%
where $A_\mu^a$ are the gluon fields and $g_s$ is the strong coupling constant. The covariant derivative is written as
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:qcd_covariant_derivative}
  D_\mu = \partial_\mu + i g_s T_a A_\mu^a .
\end{equation}
%
The full QCD Lagrangian is then given by
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:qcd_lagrangian}
  \mathcal{L}_\textnormal{QCD} = 
  - \frac{1}{4} G^{a}_{\mu\nu} G_{a}^{\mu\nu}
  + q_k (i \slashed{D} - m_k) q_k .
\end{equation}
%
Cubic and quartic terms of the gauge fields $A^a_\mu$ appear in the Lagrangian, leading to the gluon's self interaction.

The QCD coupling constant $g_s$ varies, or ``runs'', with energy.
At lower energy scales (and corresponding larger distance scales) the interaction is strong.
This leads to quark confinement, whereby an attempt to isolate individual colour-charged quarks requires so much energy that additional quark-antiquark pairs are produced.
At higher energy scales (and corresponding smaller distance scales), asymptotic freedom occurs as the interactions become weaker, allowing perturbative calculations to be performed.
Hadrons are bound states of quarks.
They are invariant under $SU(3)$ gauge transformations (i.e. are colour-charge neutral, or \textit{colourless}).



\subsection{The Electroweak Sector}\label{sec:ew_sector}

The weak and electromagnetic forces are unified in the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam (GWS) model of electroweak interaction \cite{Glashow:1961tr,Weinberg:1967tq,Salam:1968rm}.
The Lagrangian is specified by requiring invariance under the symmetry group $SU(2)_L \otimes U(1)_Y$, as motivated by a large amount of experimental data \cite{PhysRev.104.254,PhysRev.105.1413,PhysRev.105.1415}.
Here, $SU(2)_L$ is referred to as weak isospin and $U(1)_Y$ as weak hypercharge.
%(the product of the isospin and hypercharge groups.).

The generators of $SU(2)_L$ are $T_a = \sigma_a/2$, where $\sigma_a$ are the three Pauli spin matrices which satisfy the commutation relation 
%
\begin{equation}
\com{T_a}{T_b} = i \varepsilon_{abc} T_c .
\end{equation}
%
The generator of $U(1)_Y$ is $Y = 1/2$.
Each generator corresponds to a gauge field, which, after symmetry breaking (discussed in \cref{sec:sm_higgs}), give rise to the massive vector bosons, \Wpm and \Zboson, and the massless photon.
The massive vector bosons are the carriers of the weak force.
%, and are unique to the weak sector.
Due to the mass of the force carriers, the weak force has a short range and so it appears weak even though its intrinsic strength is comparable to that of QED.
%The gauge bosons acquire mass through the Higgs mechanism, discussed in \cref{sec:sm_higgs}.

The charge operator $Q$ can be written as a combination of the third $SU(2)_L$ generator and the $U(1)_Y$ generator as in
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:charge_operator}
  Q = T_3 + Y .
\end{equation}
%

The weak force violates parity conservation, i.e. weak interactions are not invariant under parity transformations (mirror reflections).
Only left handed fermions participate in the weak interaction.
Since there is no other force through which neutrinos interact with other particles, there are no right handed neutrinos in the Standard Model.
%\tnoodo{add parity operator def?}
%The Standard Model incorporates parity violation by expressing the weak interaction as a chiral gauge interaction. Only the left-handed components of particles and right-handed components of antiparticles participate in weak interactions in the Standard Model. The weak force couples only to left handed particles in currents of the form $J^\mu = \overline{\nu}_e \gamma^\mu (1 - \gamma^5) e$ or $J^\mu = \overline{u} \gamma^\mu (1 - \gamma^5) \tilde{d}$. The $\tilde{d}$ state is due to the quark mixing: mass eigenstates are not the same as weak eigenstates.
%Furthermore, the weak sector exhibits CP violation.
%CP violation is one of the three necessary Sakharov conditions required to produce baryon asymmetry in the Universe.
%Since the SM alone does not appear to have enough CP violation to generate the cosmologically observed matter-antimatter asymmetry, looking for signs of more experimental CP violation is considered to be a promising way to discover new physics.






\section{The Higgs Mechanism}\label{sec:sm_higgs}

The Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism (henceforth just the ``Higgs mechanism'') is the process through which the fundamental particles of the SM acquire mass \cite{Englert:1964et,Higgs:1964pj,Guralnik:1964eu}.
Experimentally it was known that the weak force had a low effective strength, which was suggestive of a massive mediating gauge particle.
% heisenberg uncertainty principle - at low energies can borrow enough mass to create a mediator, but only for a short time, leading to short range
However, directly adding mass to the weak gauge bosons violates the non-Abelian symmetry of the SM.
Instead, the gauge bosons acquire mass through their interaction with a scalar Higgs doublet during the spontaneous breakdown of symmetry as discussed in \cref{sec:sm_ewsb}.
Similarly, the Higgs mechanism gives mass to the fermions, as discussed in \cref{sec:higgs_yukawa_coupling}.
\cref{sec:higgs_pheno} described some basic phenomenology of the Higgs particle relevant to hadron colliders.


\subsection{Electroweak Symmetry Breaking}\label{sec:sm_ewsb}

Spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) is a key part of the Higgs mechanism. It is the transition of a physical system from a state of manifest symmetry to a state of hidden, or \textit{broken}, symmetry. In particular, this applies to physical systems where the Lagrangian observes some symmetry, but the lowest energy vacuum states do not exhibit that same symmetry. In other words, the symmetry is broken for perturbations around the vacuum state.

Consider the case in which the gauge fields from the local $SU(2)_L \otimes U(1)_Y$ symmetry group (discussed in \cref{sec:ew_sector}) are coupled to a complex scalar field $\phi = \phi(x)$, which transforms as a weak isospin doublet.
Omitting the kinetic term of the gauge fields, and writing $\phi^2 \equiv \phi^\dagger \phi$, the Lagrangian is
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:sm_higgs_lagrangian}
  \mathcal{L}_{\textnormal{Higgs}} = 
  (D_\mu \phi)^\dagger (D^\mu \phi) - \left[ \mu^2 \phi^2 + \frac{1}{2} \lambda^2 \phi^4 \right],
\end{equation}
%
where the covariant derivative is given by
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:sm_higgs_cov_derivative}
  D_\mu = \partial_\mu + i g A^a_\mu T^a + i g^\prime B_\mu ,
\end{equation}
%
and $T^a$ are the generators of $SU(2)$.
The potential term $V(\phi)$ is made up of a quadratic and quartic term in the scalar field $\phi$, which each contain an arbitrary parameter, respectively $\lambda$ and $\mu$.
The quartic term gives the field self-interaction, and cannot be negative as this would lead to a potential that was unbounded from below.
The quadratic term can be positive or negative.
In the case where the quadratic term is positive, it is interpreted as a mass term for the scalar field.
By choosing $\mu^2 < 0$ the field becomes unphysical due to its negative mass.
The shape of the potential in this case is shown in \cref{fig:higgs_potential}.
Note that in the case of the Standard Model, the scalar field $\phi$ is a complex doublet, and so the corresponding potential is 5-dimensional.
%
\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  \centering
  \input{chapters/1.theory/figs/higgs_potential.tex}
  \caption{

  }
  \label{fig:higgs_potential}
\end{figure}
%


In order to obtain a physical interpretation of the Lagrangian in \cref{eq:sm_higgs_lagrangian} for the case where $\mu^2 < 0$, the field $\phi$ is expanded around the vacuum state.
The vacuum expectation value (VEV) is the expected value of the field $\phi$ which minimises the potential $V(\phi)$ (equivalently the expected value of the field operator $\phi$ when the system is in a vacuum state, $|\langle{\phi}\rangle_0|^2 \equiv |\bra{0} \phi \ket{0}|^2 \equiv \vev{\phi}$).
%It is worth mentioning explicitly at this point that each base operator $\phi_i$ explicitly defines its own vev $\vev{\phi_i}$
Minimising the potential yields a VEV of
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:higgs_vev}
  \vev{\phi} = -\mu^2 / \lambda = v^2 .
\end{equation}
%
Due to the shape of the potential in \cref{fig:higgs_potential}, there is a degeneracy in the direction that the complex doublet $\phi$ points.
As all the different vacuum states minimise the potential and therefore yield identical physics, one can arbitrarily choose the state to lie along the second component of the doublet.
Application of \cref{eq:charge_operator} shows this choice is manifestly invariant under the charge operator.
This allows the identification of the unbroken subgroup $U(1)_Q$, under which the ground state is invariant.
The generator of $U(1)_Q$ is the charge operator $Q$.


%Different vacuum states are traversed by moving in flat directions of the potential.
%Particles corresponding to fluctuations of the field along the flat directions in the potential are massless as they don't cost energy to attain.

% MORE ON PHYSICAL PARTICLE INTERP AND FIELD SUBSTITUITON
%For a field to be able to have the standard particle interpretation, it must be linear in creation and annihilation operators. Such a field has a vanishing vacuum expectation value. As such, fields with nonvanishing VEV cannot correspond to particles. The new field H has vanishing VEV
%  Now considering fluctuations (particle content) around this vacuum we obtain $\phi(\mathrm{x}) = v + f(\mathrm{x})$ as the sum of the vacuum contribution and scalar particle fluctuations. In effect, this is a field substitution, where the new field has the property $\vev{f} = 0$ (i.e $f = 0$ minimises the potential $V(\phi)$).
% This is the motivation behind the field substitution in equation (4.3), where the newly introduced
%field has a vanishing VEV by construction. Note that the original field remains massless, whereas the newly
%introduced field (corresponding to a physical particle) gains mass.


Adding the particle content back to the theory by expanding the field around the vacuum state, and making a transformation to the unitary gauge to remove unphysical Nambu-Goldstone modes (which arise in the context of global symmetries \cite{PhysRev.117.648,Goldstone1961FieldTW}), yields
% adding particle content is performing a field substitution
%transformation to the unitary gauge to regain physical interpretation
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:unitary_higgs}
  \phi = 
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
  \begin{bmatrix}
    0 \\ v + H
  \end{bmatrix} ,
\end{equation}
%
where $H$ is a real scalar field, the \textit{true vacuum} Higgs field.
Substituting this into \cref{eq:sm_higgs_lagrangian} and identifying physical fields from the quadratic terms of linear combinations of unphysical fields, one can write the physical fields $W_\mu^\pm$, $Z_\mu$ and $A_\mu$ in terms of the original fields $A^a_\mu$ and $B_\mu$.
%The physical fields are the natural mass eigenstates that yield quadratic terms of the form $m^2 \chi^\mu\chi_\mu$.
This gives
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ew_physical_unphysical_fields}
  W_\mu^\pm = 
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (A^1_\mu \mp i A^2_\mu)
  \quad
  \begin{bmatrix}
    A_\mu \\ Z_\mu
  \end{bmatrix} =
  \begin{bmatrix}
      \cos\theta_W &  \sin\theta_W \\ 
    - \sin\theta_W &  \cos\theta_W
  \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix}
    B_\mu \\ A^3_\mu 
  \end{bmatrix} .
\end{equation}
%
where $\theta_W$ is the weak mixing angle defined by 
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ew_coupling_weak_mixing_angle}
  \cos\theta_W = \frac{g}{\sqrt{g^2 + {g^\prime}^2}} .
\end{equation}
%
The corresponding masses of the now massive vector bosons can be read off as 
%
\begin{equation}
  m_W = \frac{1}{2} g v
  \quad
  m_Z = \frac{m_W}{\cos\theta_W} , %v^2 = \frac{m_W^2}{\cos^2\theta_W} .
\end{equation}
%
while the photon remains massless.
The Higgs mass is $m_H = v \sqrt{\lambda} = \mu$.

This is the Higgs mechanism.
It maintains the renormalisability and unitarity of the SM whilst allowing the weak vector bosons to acquire mass.
In summary, an unphysical complex scalar field $\phi$ with a nonzero VEV leads to spontaneous symmetry breaking.
Due to the non-Abelian symmetry breaking, would\nobreakdash-be massless Nambu-Goldstone modes, which arise after expansion around the true vacuum state, are cancelled out by making a local gauge transformation to the unitary gauge, and instead are absorbed by the vector bosons, allowing them to acquire mass.

This sector of the SM contains four fundamental parameters that must be determined from experiment.
These can be specified by the Lagrangian parameters $g$, $g^\prime$, $v$ and $\lambda$ or the physically measurable parameters $m_Z$, $\sin\theta_W$, $m_H$ and $e$.
In the local neighbourhood around the true vacuum, the macroscopic symmetry of the system is not realised, and therefore the physical particles do not obey the original symmetry. 
However, information about the symmetry is retained through some additional constraints on the parameters of the theory.
Prior to symmetry breaking, the potential contained two terms and two constants. After symmetry breaking there are three terms but still only two constants that relate these terms. This is the vestige of the original symmetry. %Because we have related $\mu$, $\lambda$ and $v$, when these would be three independent parameters if we had no symmetry.
%Note critically that symmetry places conditions on the two interaction terms, which are related to each other through the constants $\lambda$ and $v$. As $v$ already parameterises the mass of the field $f$, these two interaction terms are described by only one additional constant $\lambda$, when in general these terms could have their own independent coupling.

Spontaneous symmetry breaking has modified the original symmetry group of the SM $SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y \rightarrow SU(3)_C \otimes U(1)_Q$.
Three broken generators from the symmetry group $SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$ have been absorbed into the definition of the physical weak vector bosons, giving them mass.
The same methodology can be used to generate the fermion masses, as shown in the next section. 



\subsection{Fermionic Yukawa Coupling}\label{sec:higgs_yukawa_coupling}

Adding the masses of the fermions by hand breaks the gauge invariance of the theory.
%
\begin{comment}
the necessity for fermion masses being generated in this way is different from that of the vector bosons, which cannot have locally invariant bilinear field terms in the Lagrangian. For the fermions, we cannot write a mass term due to the 

The reason is as follows: consider the standard \textbf{Dirac mass term} that we use to give mass to particles 
%
\begin{equation}\label{dirac mass term}
    m \overline{\psi} \psi = m (\overline{\psi}_L + \overline{\psi}_R) ({\psi}_L + {\psi}_R) = m({\overline{\psi}}_L \psi_R + \overline{\psi}_R \psi_L) ,
\end{equation}
%
where the $\overline{\psi}_L \psi_L$ and $\overline{\psi}_R \psi_R$ vanish due to the anticommutation of $\gamma^5 \gamma^0 = - \gamma^0 \gamma^5$, and the fact tat $P_L P_R = P_R P_L = 0$. Concretely, we have
%
\begin{equation}\label{same chirality spinor bilinear vanishes}
    \overline{\psi}_L \psi_L = \psi^\dagger P_L \gamma^0 P_L \psi = \overline{\psi} P_R P_L \psi = 0.
\end{equation}
%
Note that $\overline{\psi}_L = \overline{\psi_L}$. Now, \cref{dirac mass term} is note invariant under electroweak gauge transformations as the LH spinors transform under $SU(2)_L$ while RH spinors transform under $U(1)_Y$ (i.e. we could do an $SU(2)$ transformation that would affect $\psi_L$ but not $\psi_R$ which is clearly not invariant).

Instead, we can use a Yukawa coupling between the fermion fields and the Higgs field in order to generate mass terms after spontaneous electroweak symmetry breakdown \cite{Weinberg:1967tq}.
In this way, the fermion masses are determined by both the respective couplings to the Higgs field and the VEV of the Higgs field itself, which sets the basic mass scale of the theory.

The Higgs field $\phi$ transforms as an $SU(2)$ doublet with $Y = 1/2$, as does the left-handed fermion field $\psi_L$.
The right-handed fermion field $\psi_R$ transforms as an $SU(2)$ singlet.

\subsubsection{Charged Lepton Masses}

The renormalisable and gauge invariant coupling between a fermionic field $\psi$ and a scalar Higgs field $\phi$ can be written as 
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:yukawa_fermion_coupling}
  \mathcal{L}_{\textnormal{Yukawa}} = 
  - g_f (\overline{\psi}_L \phi \psi_R + \overline{\psi}_R \phi^\dagger \psi_L) .
\end{equation}
%
where $\psi_L = (\nu_L, e_L)$ and $\psi_R = e_R$ for the first generation leptons.
After spontaneous symmetry breaking (see \cref{sec:sm_ewsb}), the scalar Higgs field in unitary gauge \cref{eq:unitary_higgs} consists of a VEV and the true vacuum Higgs field $H$.
Substituting this in to \cref{eq:yukawa_fermion_coupling} yields
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:lep_mass_term}
  \mathcal{L}_{\textnormal{Yukawa}} = 
  - \frac{v g_e}{\sqrt{2}} \overline{e} e
  - \frac{g_e}{\sqrt{2}} \overline{e} H e ,
\end{equation}
%
using $\overline{e} e = (\overline{e}_L + \overline{e}_R)(e_L + e_R) = \overline{e}_L e_R + \overline{e}_R e_L$.
The VEV component of $\phi$ provides the first term in \cref{eq:lep_mass_term} which is quadratic in the electron field, and can therefore be identified as the electron mass term.
An interaction term between the electron field $e$ and the true vacuum Higgs field $H$ is also present.
Mass is generated for the other charged lepton generations in the same way.

\subsubsection{Quark Masses}

The down-type quarks acquire their mass analogous to the leptons, with $\psi_L = (u_L, d_L)$ and $\psi_R = d_R$ for the first quark generation.
Mass is generated for the up-type quarks using the conjugate field to $\phi$ which transforms under $SU(2)$ as a doublet with $Y = -1/2$.
The conjugate field $\tilde{\phi}$ is constructed as
%
\begin{equation}\label{phi c field definition}
    \tilde{\phi} = 
    i \sigma_2 \phi^\dagger = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
    0 & 1 \\ -1 & 0
    \end{bmatrix} 
    \begin{bmatrix}
    {\phi_1}^\dagger \\ {\phi_2}^\dagger
    \end{bmatrix} =
    \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix}
      v + H \\ 0
    \end{bmatrix}
    ,
\end{equation}
%
and transforms in the same way as $\phi$. 
This field can be used to write an additional Yukawa coupling which provides mass for the up-type quarks in a similar way as before.
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:up_quark_mass}
  \mathcal{L}_{\textnormal{Yukawa}}^{\textnormal{up}} = 
  - g_q (\overline{\psi}_L \tilde{\phi} \psi_R + \overline{\psi}_R \tilde{\phi}^\dagger \psi_L)
\end{equation}
%
Considering the first generation of up-type quarks with $\psi_L = (u_L, d_L)$ and $\psi_R = u_R$, substitution into \cref{eq:up_quark_mass} yields 
%
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L}_{\textnormal{Yukawa}}^{\textnormal{up}} = 
  - \frac{v g_u}{\sqrt{2}} \overline{u} u
  - \frac{g_u}{\sqrt{2}} \overline{u} H u .
\end{equation}
%
The Yukawa terms mix quarks of different generations.
Physical particles are detected in their mass eigenstates $q$, which diagonalise the mass matrix, but interact via the weak interaction according to their weak eigenstates $\tilde{q}$, which are superpositions of the mass eigenstates.
This feature of the weak sector leads to mixing between different generations of quarks.
Quark mixing can be expressed using the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix, which specifies the strength of flavour-changing weak currents.
The entries in the matrix are enumerated as
%For example, the object that couples to the up quark is $\tilde{d} = V_{ud} d + V_{us} s$
%
\begin{equation}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \tilde{d} \\ \tilde{s} \\ \tilde{b} 
    \end{bmatrix}
    = \begin{bmatrix}
        V_{ud} & V_{us} & V_{ub} \\  
        V_{cd} & V_{cs} & V_{cb} \\  
        V_{td} & V_{ts} & V_{tb} 
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        {d} \\ {s} \\ {b} 
    \end{bmatrix} ,

\subsection{Higgs Sector Phenomenology}\label{sec:higgs_pheno}


As previously discussed in this chapter, the Higgs field plays a key role in the SM by giving mass to fundamental particles. 
%The Higgs itself gains mass through self interaction.
The strength of the coupling between the Higgs field and another particle is proportional to that particle's mass.
This fact dictates which production mechanisms and decay modes are dominant at the \LHC.
The cross sections for different production mechanisms at a centre of mass energy \come{13} are shown as a function of the Higgs mass $m_H$ in \cref{fig:higgs_production_xs}.
At leading order in QCD, Higgs boson production occurs mainly through four modes, shown in \cref{fig:higgs_prod}.
The dominant production mode is gluon-gluon fusion ($pp \rightarrow H$), which is predominantly mediated by a virtual top quark loop.
Vector boson fusion ($pp \rightarrow qqH$) is the second most likely production mechanism, in which a pair of \Wboson or \Zboson bosons fuse to produce a Higgs after being radiated by two quarks.
Next most common is the associated production of a Higgs boson and a vector boson ($pp \rightarrow VH$), in which a pair of quarks fuse to produce a single \Wboson or \Zboson boson which radiates a Higgs.
The final of the four leading production modes is top quark fusion ($pp \rightarrow ttH$), in which two gluons each radiate a quark-antiquark pair, and a quark from each pair fuses to produce a Higgs boson.

    Higgs boson production cross sections as a function of Higgs mass ($m_H$) at $\sqrt{s} = \SI{13}{\TeV}$~\cite{deFlorian:2016spz}.
    Uncertainties are shown in the shaded bands.
    At $m_H = \SI{125}{\GeV}$, Higgs boson production is dominated by gluon-gluon fusion, vector boson fusion, associated production with vector bosons, and top quark fusion.
  }
  \label{fig:higgs_production_xs}
\end{figure}

Although gluon-gluon fusion is the dominant production mode, for hadronic decays of the Higgs boson the associated production with a vector boson has the advantage of leading to a more distinct final state due to the likelihood of the vector bosons decaying to leptons.
Leptons provide clean signals to detect and trigger on.

\end{figure}

Since the Higgs boson couples proportional to mass, decays to heavier particles are favoured.
The branching ratios of different Higgs boson decay modes are shown as a function of $m_H$ in \cref{fig:higgs_br}.
Approximately \pct{58} of the time the Higgs boson decays to a pair of \bquarks, the dominant decay mode.
The next most likely decay mode is to a pair of \Wboson bosons, which occurs approximately \pct{20} of the time.
% since the Higgs it not massive enough to decay to a pair for top quarks (recall from \cref{tab:sm_fermions} $m_b = \SI{4.18}{\GeV}$ and $m_t = \SI{173}{\GeV}$).
After the \bquark, the next heaviest fermions are the tau lepton and the \cquark, decays to pairs of these particles happen approximately an order of magnitude less often.
Decays to pairs of vector bosons are via a virtual off shell Higgs boson only.
%, since the combined vector boson mass is greater than the Higgs mass.
While the \Hgammagamma and $\PH \rightarrow \Zboson \Zboson$ branching ratios are small compared with fermionic decay modes (around \pct{0.2} for \Hgammagamma), these decay channels were instrumental in the initial discovery of the Higgs due to the low level of background processes which mimic the final state \cite{HIGG-2012-27,CMS-HIG-12-028}.

This thesis presents a measurement of the cross section of Higgs bosons produced in association with a vector boson and decaying to a pair of \bquarks, i.e. $pp \rightarrow \VHbb'$.
The \Hbb decay mode directly probes the Higgs coupling to fermions, and more specifically to the bottom quark.
This coupling was first observed in 2018 \cite{ATLAS-CONF-2018-036,CMS-HIG-18-016}.
Ongoing work measuring the coupling strengths, in particular in the high energy regime, is the focus of the analysis presented in this thesis in \cref{chap:vhbb_boosted}.
