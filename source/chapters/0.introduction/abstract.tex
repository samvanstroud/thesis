This thesis presents work on improvement of the tracking and \btagging algorithms used by \ATLAS to perform \btagging at high transverse momenta.
Novel approaches, such as the classification of track origins and the application of graph neural networks have been successfully employed to markedly improve the \btagging performance at high \pt.
Work on analaysis of \Hbb decays was also performned using \SI{13}{\TeV} proton-proton collision data from the course of \runtwo.
