\chapter{Introduction}\label{chap:intro}


This thesis describes various efforts in improving the understanding of the Higgs boson and its coupling to \bcquarks, primarily through the improvement of algorithmic tools, discussed in \cref{chap:track_classification_mva,chap:gnn_tagger}.

% â€˜algorithmic work and studies of the H->bb final-state
Analysis work on \Hbb decays is also described in \cref{chap:vhbb_boosted}.
