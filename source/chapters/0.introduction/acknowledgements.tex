Firstly I would like to thank my supervisor Tim Scanlon for all the guidance and support he has offered over the course of this doctorate.
Tim has always been consistent with clear explanations and sound advice throughout the last four years.
I would also like to thank everyone I've worked with at UCL and at ATLAS.
In particular Jonathan Shlomi for the fruitful collaboration on advancements in flavour tagging, and Brian Moser and Hannah Arnold for their patient and kind support during the course of the \VHbb analysis.
Finally, I'm grateful to all those I've worked with in the Tracking and Flavour Tagging groups, in particular to Gabriel Facini, S\'ebastien Rettie, Valerio Dao, Bingxuan Liu and Francesco Di Bello for their guidance, and to Dan Guest for his fastidious merge request reviews.
