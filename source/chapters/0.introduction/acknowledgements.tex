Firstly I give thanks to my supervisor Tim Scanlon for all the guidance and support he has offered over the course of this doctorate.
Tim has always been consistent with clear explanations and sound advice throughout the last four years.
I would also like to thank everyone I've worked with at ATLAS and at UCL.
In particular I have Jonathan Shlomi to thank for the fruitful collaboration on advancements in flavour tagging.
I would also like to thank Brian Moser and Hannah Arnold for their patient support during the course of the \VHbb analysis.
I'm grateful to everyone I've worked with in the ATLAS Flavour Tagging and Tracking groups, in particular to Gabriel Facini, Valerio Dao, Bingxuan Liu and Francesco Di Bello for their guidance, and Dan Guest for his fastidious merge request reviews.
This thesis was made in \LaTeXe{} using the ``hepthesis'' class~\cite{Buckley:2010:hepthesis}.
