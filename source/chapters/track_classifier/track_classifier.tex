\subsection{Fake Tracks Identification Tool}\label{sec:remove fakes mva}

Probably talk about this model as a stepping stone to the general classifier


\subsection{\bhadron Decay Track Identification Tool}\label{sec:keep hf mva}

Maybe don't need this section since it was talked about less


\section{General Track Origin Classifier Tool}

Culmination of this work in the general tool Martino has implemented

Applications:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Frack to jet association
    \item Fake track studies (removal and for recommendations)
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
