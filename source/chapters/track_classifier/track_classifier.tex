\section{Machine Learning Background for Track Classification}\label{sec:ml_track_classification}
\section{Track Truth Origin Labelling}\label{sec:track_labelling}
\section{Fake Track Identification Tool}\label{sec:fake_track_mva}
Probably talk about this model as a stepping stone to the general classifier

\subsection{\bhadron Decay Track Identification Tool}\label{sec:keep hf mva}
Maybe don't need this section since it was talked about less


\section{General Track Origin Classifier Tool}\label{sec:general_track_classifier}
Culmination of this work in the general tool Martino has implemented

Applications:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Frack to jet association
    \item Fake track studies (removal and for recommendations)
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}

Improved with GNNs
