Recap why flavour tagging at high pT is important.

Recap challenges
\begin{itemize}
    \item tracking suffers from several problems which might be improved by...
    \item tracking might be improved by...
\end{itemize}

algorithmic gains in flavour tagging can improve things. future work on that front:
\begin{itemize}
    \item use more info for flavour tagging (hits, calo info, leptons)
    \item more aux tasks, energy, mass, lxy regression
\end{itemize}

ultimately analyses will benefit greatly, in particualr boosted xbb tagging and dihiggs analysis
