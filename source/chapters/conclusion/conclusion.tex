flavour tagging at high pT is important because

tracking suffers from several problems which might be improved by

algorithmic gains in flavour tagging can improve things

ultimately analsyes will benefit greatly


future work:
\begin{itemize}
    \item improve tracking
    \item use more info for flavour tagging
    \item improve jet labelling
    \item boosted xbb tagging
    \item lead to dihiggs
\end{itemize}
