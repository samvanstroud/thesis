    \caption{
        Acceptance uncertainties for the \ttbar background.
        The uncertainties on the 0- and 1-lepton channels are found to be similar, but are conservatively taken to be uncorrelated. 
        The HP-to-LP SR uncertainty is applied in the HP SR.
        The Medium-to-high $p_T^V$ uncertainty is applied in the high $p_T^V$ bin, and is larger than the computed uncertainty in order to account for the known mismodelling of the \ttbar \pt spectrum.
